# HelpfulBot

Our project is a Discord bot that will remind you to drink water and get up and stretch every so often while also providing examples of stretches to do. The bot will see when the user is online and will start counting time once that is detected. If the user is offline then no reminders will be sent. We believe this is helpful to gamers because if they are on their computer, Discord is also on, and we cause use this information to provide them reminders at the perfect time!
